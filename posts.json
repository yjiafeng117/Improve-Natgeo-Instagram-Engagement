Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called \"\"cracker\"\" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called \"\"crackers\"\", attributed to the \"\"crack\"\" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands.

They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland.

What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people\u2019s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc9ato see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving #conservation #carnevores #northernkenya #kenya", "250k", "593"], "463": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a58677a2ce3214c6b77747a0632e2c6d/5C68AD05/t51.2885-15/e15/c176.0.727.727/s640x640/43778286_1773377629434556_7384765115684088578_n.jpg", "Photo by @chien_chi_chang | I have been working in New York\u2019s Chinatown since 1992\u2014for more than 26 years\u2014and it is still a project in progress.

The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an \"\"upturned, densely packed crown\"\". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as \"\"dragon's blood\"\". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock.

But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts.

It measured \"only\" 200 m in circumference but it was already too large to see it completely under water.

The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. \nArchaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE).

After two years of chasing Florida panthers with camera traps nearly full time, it had become common for weeks to go by without holding a camera in my hands. So I set the high-tech equipment aside and went to Missouri with just one camera for an immersive experience that involved a lot of looking, listening and waiting. Each student was limited to just 400 photos for the week, with no deletions. When I am on assignment, I often shoot 1000 photos in a day. But the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. By watching and waiting we would know when a moment was building and we should trust ourselves respond. By Wednesday evening I had watched the Fry brothers drive the tractor two previous times. But when I saw this sunset forming and heard the tractor coming on the third night, I started running down the hill, remembering the floodlights on the cab that could balance exposure with the western sky.

In Scotland the season runs from 01 October through 15 April each year. Much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. How often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. After 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. If the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. By creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. Patches are burnt every eight to thirty years.

Djime Said, 50, is the lone survivor of a Conservation Ranger massacre at Heban, Chad. Six Zakouma National Park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the Sudanese military. A few weeks earlier, the Rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. The poachers were out of camp at the time. These poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the Rangers were sleeping. They would have woken to a hail of A.K rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. Djime Said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. In his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. He found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the Ranger post at Heban. He was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. He spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. He received $2000 compensation from the Chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for Zakouma after this experience. Since the time of the attack, the parks \u201cMamba\u201d teams have greatly improved security, this coupled with better relations with the nomads in the region have developed an intelligence network that safeguards both the animals and the people trying to protect them.

There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid \"When the buying stops the killing can too\u201d\n\nPoisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. \nThere are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

The Arabs have contributed a great deal to the recovery of falcons since the time of the Silent Spring. They have sponsored nesting sites in Mongolia to protect falcons on the steppes, they intensively breed prey species for hunting to minimize impact in host countries and their passion for the sport has led the creation of a new class of captive bred \u201csuper-birds\u201d that have come to replace much of the illegally trafficked falcon trade from the wild. The falcon hospitals of the UAE are something to behold as are the relationships between certain falconers and their birds, far surpassing notions of what is possible between man and raptor. Peter and I spent time with the influential master falconer Sheik Butti al Maktoum in the UAE and his breeding maestro Howard Waller. They represent a perfect example of how the natural world can unite people in a common mission despite huge cultural differences. I see great potential for better understanding between Islam and the West through the lens of conservation, a higher value system that should unite us in this time of divisiveness. In this story we also examine the deadly effects of electricity pylons and the way they kill millions of raptors every year. In an image seen here, over 300 precious Saker falcons lie dead, a tiny sampling collected over one year from a 55 kilometer stretch of powerline in Mongolia. Millions of raptors are killed in this manner every year. It only requires a small design tweak to prevent this from happening and all future designs could and should include this. #natgeo #falcons #conservation #UnitedArabEmirates #Falconry", "239k", "776"], "893": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7d456c710f1b9507eaaec73c06ac8d3f/5C816625/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c181.0.718.718/s640x640/41977775_2039372989448376_5451246374844940061_n.jpg", "Photos by @JoelSartore and Carl Akeley | With his project the National Geographic Photo Ark, Joel Sartore is using the power of photography to inspire people to help save species at risk before it\u2019s too late.

I realized I had to go to a different well if my work was going to grow; I had to find a different palette, a different culture. I heard through the grapevine that the magazine was going to do a story about Peru and I somehow felt an absolute need to get the assignment to do the photography. Here, in this image, done within just a few days of my arrival in Peru, I was in a small Andean village where six people had been killed by an earthquake. The Peruvian government had sent a helicopter with a medical team and a priest to the village and these young girls are peering, open mouthed, and awestruck. They had never seen a doctor before. While working in Peru I met and fell in love with a woman who several years later would become my wife. She was walking through the Plaza des Armas in Ayacucho during Easter week in 1981. I followed her around the Plaza for a while before building the courage to ask if she spoke English which she firmly answered, \"\"No\"\". And that was that until another day not much later when I was able to engage her in an invitation to join my group to attend a cultural event one night, and with that evening the beginning of our romance took flame.

Grizzly bears are a true symbol for wilderness. Thirty years ago there were less than 150 grizzly bears left in the Greater Yellowstone area. Thanks to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act numbers of the iconic bears have recovered since then from near extinction to more than 700 individuals. This recovery, however, led to Trump administration to de-list the species from federal protection resulting in Wyoming and Idaho to issue trophy hunting licenses for as many as 23 bears.\nJust two days before the sports hunt of grizzlies in the area would have started this fall, federal judge Dana Christensen ordered that the grizzly bears kept their protection status.\nLess than 2,000 grizzlies call the Lower 48 states their home today, compared to more than 100,000 in historical times. Let give the surviving bears some space. Their habitat has been strongly fragmented, so the remaining bears are distributed over several island populations. \nBears are facing increased pressure from the effects of climate change, like the loss of important food sources like whitebark pine seeds. It is essential to continue to work on restoring bear habitat, creating wildlife corridors and reconnecting the Yellowstone bears with the other populations of the Lower 48.

Japan\u2019s ivory industry today, Thornton adds, is \u201cgreater than any other nation on Earth.\u201d While China had some 170 ivory outlets nationwide prior to its ban, Japan has 8,200 retailers, 300 manufacturers, and 500 wholesalers. \u201cIn the 1980s Japan was so notorious, not only in terms of the volume of ivory it consumed but also for illegal trade,\u201d says Isao Sakaguchi, a professor of international relations and global environmental governance at Gakushuin University, in Tokyo. \u201cJapan was responsible for the near extinction of African elephants in most of their range states.\u201d Legal trade in ivory inevitably creates loopholes for illegal trade and #Japan has loopholes you can drive a ship through. National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer has done a superb job of reporting on the implications of Japan\u2019s decision to continue with their ivory trade.

The giant sphinx moth is thought to be the only pollinator because it\u2019s mouth parts are long enough to reach to the bottom of the nectar spur for the sweet reward that draws the moth deep enough into the flower to get pollen stuck on its head, or to share pollen already there from another ghost.

At this stage, he had walked all the way from Ethiopia. The next day, because of a mix up, Paul and I were arrested by the secret service. Here is an extract from Paul\u2019s evocative text, from the September issue of @natgeo magazine:\n\"Early that morning, in a coarse ice mist, we set out with two pack donkeys to climb Irshad Pass. Climbing a mountain under such conditions is a strange and disorienting experience. It was like scaling a frozen and crazily tilted sea. We tottered along ice-rimed cliffs. Snow hid fatal crevices. Sometimes the donkeys fell through the crust and refused to get up. By midday a blizzard was in full gust.\n\u201cHello, Arthur, can you do me a favour?\u201d Paley was shouting into the satellite phone. We couldn\u2019t see a hundred steps ahead, much less the peaks far above. Paley\u2019s brother in Paris googled and read out to us the GPS coordinates for Irshad.\nIrshad Pass rises to 16,335 feet above sea level. We finally reached it at sunset. Paley ventured a feeble victory dance. I gulped air so thin and metallic it cut my lungs like razor blades. Gales had scoured the summit to raw bedrock. Without shelter or firewood, it was a hazardous place to camp. But we had little choice.\nPlainclothes Pakistani security forces confronted us the next night while we camped at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush. We had notified the government of our plan to enter Pakistan via Irshad. We carried valid visas issued in advance. But the officers, armed with AK-47s, insisted we had trespassed into a restricted zone. Overnight, they drove us to the frontier town of Gilgit. In detention there, I overheard Paley, curled on his cot, parroting in his emphatic Norman accent the lines from a film playing on his hidden mobile phone: \u201cAn eye for an eye only ends up making see whole world blind.\u201d \u201cMatthieu,\u201d I whispered, \u201care you watching Gandhi in an intelligence agency safe house?\u201d\nFollow @paleyphoto for more images from this @natgeo assignment. #Karakoram #hindukush #mountainpass #afghanborder #natgeo #mediumformat", "305k", "593"], "1093": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2b74e1b863ef9bf19e30b444f98197ac/5C6C6AA2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c180.0.720.720/s640x640/41602423_2139653072918716_7263501813873334730_n.jpg", "Photo by @EdKashi | I recently worked with the @the_endfund and @talkingeyesmedia on a film and photo series about the topic of ending river blindness in Senegal.

I would often take part in a child\u2019s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities between children living worlds apart.

Bisrat Melake, 60 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia / ENJERA WITH CHURRY AND VEGETABLES- Difficulty: medium - Time: 3 days (if you need to prepare the enjera), less than 2 hours if the enjera is already ready - Ingredients: 1 savoy, 10 sweet green chillies and 25 string beans, red chilli powder, 4 onions, oil, salt, pepper, cauliflower leaves, a plate of Mitin Shuro (yellow dried peas powder), a plate of split peas, yeast, Teff flour (cereal from Ethiopia) / To prepare this dish you need to cook different ingredients separately. It is the product of various recipes. The Enjara, whose preparation takes 3 days, is the first thing to make: ENJARA: Mix 1 kilo of teff flour and 1 spoon of yeast with some water until you obtain a smooth and dense dough - let it ferment for 3 days - now the dough should be much softer than when you prepared it 3 days before. Add water until it becomes cream-like. Use it in the same way as when you make crepes. If you have the possibility to use an Ethiopian oven in ceramic (like the ones at her back in the photo), do use it! / CHURRY (in the centre of the photo): Stir fry 3 chopped onions and 10 chopped sweet chillies in some oil for a few minutes. Add 3 glasses of water and let it cook for about ten minutes. Then, add the split peas and the plate of Mitin Shuro. Mix well, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for about 30 minutes / CAULIFLOWER LEAVES (the dark green vegetables on the sides of the photo): Boil some cauliflower leaves in water. Drain and chop them and fry them in a pan with some oil, onion and salt / LIQUID CHURRY (the small orange spots in the photo): Fry lightly half an onion and a pinch of hot chili powder in some oil. Add 200 grams of Mitin Shuro and two glasses of water. Cook for 20 minutes / STRING BEANS AND SAVOY SALAD: Slice the savoy into stripes and chop the beans. Boil everything together in some water to suit your taste. Drain the vegetables and put them in a pan with oil and chili to saut\u00e9 them for about ten minutes / Now that all the ingredients are ready, you can place them in the dish as it is shown in the photo and serve it. #grandma", "262k", "1,669"], "1357": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/145a32c1eb63fc66ef8390ebafb768eb/5C7D44F8/t51.2885-15/e15/c181.0.718.718/s640x640/41527004_381871519016669_774468139529692823_n.jpg", "Photo by @ladzinski | The narrows in #ZionNationalPark is a well known hike that wanders up the mouth of the Virgin River, a water system that is a life line to the parks flourishing ecosystem.

Unlike most Christian denominations, the Bruderhof doesn\u2019t have consecrated church buildings. When the weather is nice, we often worship outdoors. In our community in Harlem, we have a rooftop deck, where we hold many of our worship meetings. As it says in Matthew 18:20 \u201cFor where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\" Jesus told his disciples that there are two great commandments. First: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. And secondly: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d My first task is to love and serve God, but my love to him is expressed through the love I show my neighbors. The best way for me to love God and my neighbors is by living in a Bruderhof community. For my community, the Sermon on the Mount is particularly important. In it, Jesus teaches us how to live a life of love, humility, service, purity, and forgiveness. Jesus also talks a lot about the Kingdom of God. Some people make this out just to be what\u2019s beyond the grave. It\u2019s not! It\u2019s a blueprint, a model for how we ought to live. It is a kingdom of justice, of peace, of love. We can\u2019t force it into being, but we can try our best to live it out in our own lives. \nI think every day I lose my faith and find it again. Sometimes it is hard to believe in a good God when I see all the suffering and problems in the world today, or even if I\u2019m just having a bad day. But then I look around and see God\u2019s work and beautiful creation in so many amazing and interconnected ways, people, friends, children, nature, trees, microorganisms. So I have to believe even if I don\u2019t understand it all!\"", "133k", "1,293"], "1463": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1ca49abcc25bd636f71fb13441b5aaf2/5C88FB6D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/40721985_2247863235242679_5779981077007732715_n.jpg", "Photo by @ivankphoto | Sandy Ramos visits her brother's grave with her family in Rowland Heights, California, in October, 2017.

She is the most influential member of the zoo\u2019s zebra herd, with a dynamic personality and playful nature.\n\nHave you ever wondered why zebras have stripes? There are five main hypotheses for what stripes do for this species. They are thought to: repel insects, provide camouflage through optical illusion, confuse predators, reduce body temperature, and help the animals recognize each other. Among the many theories, recent research found that zebras and certain blood-sucking insects inhabit the same places. Understanding how the stripe pattern impacts bug bites on this species may help researchers protect humans from disease-carrying insects! This species can digest taller, tougher grasses that other grazing animals have difficulty eating. As they migrate, they often move into new areas first. As they eat the high grasses, spurring more nutritious green plants to appear, allowing wildebeest and gazelles to roam in and eat. Some say zebras are white because the stripes end at their white belly. Others say black because when you shave the hair, the skin is mostly black.

The native species of guava, (Psidium galapageium), tends to produce small fruit that has thick skin, large seeds, and bitter pulp. On the other hand, the invasive species of guava, (P. guajava), has been cultivated around the world. As a result, the tree produces dense clusters of large, juicy, thin-skinned fruits that the tortoises love to eat. And furthermore it\u2019s also a matter of availability. \nBecause tortoises distribute seeds through their dung, the animals contribute to the increase of invasive guava on the islands.

Some evenings they would transfer the faces of two cadavers, switching them in order to study location of veins, nerves, structural information that would be helpful during surgery, and a myriad of other issues that would be urgently important for when a face donation arose. and other times just look through the faces to see where certain nerves were located and for structural information that will be helpful to them during surgery.

Par\u00edcutin  was the first volcano to be studied by scientists during its full life cycle. The volcano erupted quite suddenly from a farmer's corn field in 1943 and within a day was more than 50 meters tall. By the time the eruption ceased in 1952 the cinder cone was more than 700 meters tall and lava from the volcano had consumed 2 towns. All that stands now in the vast lava field is the remains of this church. Salvador is standing in what was the upper story window. There is more than 30 feet of church wall below him covered in black lava. Par\u00edcutin is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a zone of volcanic activity that covers central southern Mexico.

A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don\u2019t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids\u2019 complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I\u2019ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I\u2019ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project.

After a quarantine period, she was combined with the other fox kits in care to form an adopted litter-- which helps youngsters learn the social and hunting skills they need to survive in the wild after their release. Red foxes are born almost completely black and are therefore often mistaken for domestic puppies, raccoons, or even skunks! This species has a keen sense of vision, smell, and hearing. Their vertical pupils help them see well in the dark (like a cat) and it's said that they can hear prey moving under the snow up to 40 yards away! Red foxes are found throughout the United States and populations are considered stable, with a listing of least concern on the IUCN Red List. They adapt readily to green spaces in cities, particularly in large parks, on golf courses, and highways where they provide a valuable service to their human neighbors-- rodent control.  Although this species has a stable population, other fox species are at risk due to human encroachment on territory and human-introduced diseases such as canine distemper. Nebraska Wildlife Rehab receives more than a dozen orphaned red fox kits every year for rehabilitation, as well as several adult foxes that are injured or suffering from sarcoptic mange. Although these foxes take a lot of resources to rehabilitate, they are resilient, and are often some of the best success stories for this facility!

Excited tourists observe a whale shark that has surfaced to eat a handful of krill from a guide in a small wooden outrigger near Oslo, in the Philippines. Each day hundreds of people journey to this small seaside village to watch and swim with these gentle filter feeding giants. Operations begin at 6 am and cease at 12:30 after which the whale sharks descend into the depths and the tourists melt away. The encounter begins with an orientation about whale sharks and a set of approach rules that include keeping 5 meters from head, no touching, chasing or blocking. Long lines of tourists form as they wait for a paddler to guide a small group through the offshore loop of boats for a 30 minute experience with the sharks. The practice of feeding (provisioning) the animals with handfuls of krill is highly controversial. Supporters maintain that the whale sharks have a historic presence here and can come and go; that the practice has broadly increased the local standard of living by providing employment to fisherman and decreasing the local fishing pressure; and that the sharks have become ocean ambassadors introducing thousands to marine life, increasing ocean awareness and hopefully stewardship. On the other hand, many conservation groups and scientists recognizes that this tourism may come at a cost to the whale sharks. Research suggests that feeding modifies their natural behavior through longer residency with an unknown impact of retained congregations on their local food resources, social structure, migration, reproduction and overall health. Whale sharks, once a heavily targeted fishery in the Philippines and Taiwan, are now protected in both countries and are endangered, but remain at risk of poaching and are actively fished in China and other countries for the lucrative shark fin trade. These giants are the world\u2019s largest fish but much of their biology still remains a mystery as their populations decline around the planet. // From @natgeo assignment Philippines, An Ocean Nation // #WhaleSharkday #Ocean #Philippines #Shark #Ecotourism #OceanConservation #CoralTriangle for #MoreOcean follow @JenniferHayesig", "352k", "1,553"], "1687": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3910682a9afd94f45188d137ce0ed3cd/5C89ED8F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/39741884_1947976505494742_6898414490438598656_n.jpg", "Photo by @salvarezphoto | John Burcham cools off from the August heat in Lower Calf Creek Falls in Utah.

Rabbi Shmuley Boteach: \" I was born Jewish and as I grew older, after my parents divorced, I increased my dedication to my faith and decided as a teenager to become a rabbi.\n\nJudaism strongly believes in the power of prayer. It has a set prayer book which is taken from biblical sources, like the Book of Psalms, rabbinic sources.. and it essentially constitutes two parts. One being praise for God and the other being penitential prayer, which acknowledges the human dependency on God for our basic needs. Judaism specifically places the struggle for righteousness above perfection, to battle our nature, to be better. But it defines being better not first and foremost in terms of character improvement but in terms of societal improvement. \nIn religious terms I would say that Judaism places world redemption above personal salvation. Like, whether you're going to heaven or hell is not a question that is emphasized, whether you contributed to feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and giving sight to the sightless is much more significant.\n\nThe Torah is the most important text, the five books of Moses. And then beyond that there's twenty-four books of the Bible. And then the rabbinical interpretations of those five books, which is called the Talmud. \nThe message is that God gave ten commandments to the Jewish people, which are a code of ethical monotheism. God communicates with humans and imparts His will. In Judaism, membership in the faith is communicated either through birth to a Jewish mother or conversion to Judaism. But remember, Judaism is not just a religion; we are also a people, we're a nation. That's entry and participation in that people. \nMy faith gives me a moral code by which to live. It teaches me how to have a set of values and priorities so that my life is not distracted by a lot of the noise of the modern world whose values may not be consistent with Judaism\u2019s ancient values. It maximizes my potential by always inspiring me to be more.

But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

But she did not stop there. After resting for a while, she sat up, took a look around, and invited the cubs to nurse. She fell into a kind of trancelike state, letting her head slowly sink down in exhaustion as her cubs drank. I can still clearly hear the suckling sounds in my mind and even noticed a purring from the cubs. It was an unforgettable sight: mother and cubs, nestled together on the ice in the warm late-evening light, with drifting sea ice leading to the horizon where it meets the edge of the Austfonna ice cap in Svalbard.\u201d In late August polar bears are hanging on to the last of the drifting sea ice. To successfully raise her cubs, this mother needs the sea ice platform to hunt for seals. \nI was in awe. This bear completely trusted us.

This species is an important recycler of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems! By burying and eating carrion (dead animal flesh) they remove a source of food from flies, which are often pests and health threats. They also feed on fly eggs and larvae, helping to reduce their numbers. The precarious state of the population of American burying beetles was recognized in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Endangered Species List.  Reasons for their decline are unknown, but evidence points to habitat loss and fragmentation. Another theory is that this animal thrived by feeding on the now-extinct passenger pigeon, one of the most abundant birds the world had every seen. When they wet extinct, the beetle declined severely. Thankfully, the @stlzoo where this beetle was photographed is committed to working with conservation organizations to assist with declining populations of native plants and animals. The center has successfully bred thousands of American burying beetles on the Zoo campus and, along with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy, the Zoo is reintroducing captive-raised beetles to Southwest Missouri. #Photoark #americanburyingbeetle #criticallyendangeredspecies", "201k", "632"], "1820": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6b53fc2517e35d393fe0a4ed8f10c9af/5C776128/t51.2885-15/e15/c135.0.810.810/s640x640/39528177_2183142158583815_6675531620788731904_n.jpg", "Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio\n\nFresh back from Afghanistan, with time to reflect on previous trips... more from my work for the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) - here, a photograph of the restored Babur's Garden, nestled in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains and the fertile alluvial plains of the Kabul River basin.

This was the first chance Sandra had to see her granddaughter's donated face on Katie and it was a moving experience for both women and Katie\u2019s family as they shared family stories and prayed together. The day before the meeting Sandra sat at her kitchen table in her Medina, Ohio apartment, going through the family photos she had of her granddaughter Adrea, and thinking about the great gift that had been given to Katie with the donation of Adrea\u2019s face. It was a tough decision because organs of other kinds are more readily given but a face is different. It is the first thing people see in us and by which we are often measured and it is how we are remembered in photographs. When it was clear that Adrea would not survive her comatose state from a drug overdose, Sandra was approached by LifeBanc which told the grandmother of Katie\u2019s need for a face and how it would help move the science of face transplants forward, a major goal at the Cleveland Clinic due to the increasing number of American military members returning from wars with facial disfigurements.

They are incredibly smart animals and give the landscape another dimension of wildness. There is little chance to sneak up to a wolf. In order to get good images, one has to spend the time, win their trust and let them come to you. If one were to succeed to quietly come close, they become aware of your presence sooner or later, set off a few short barks and it is the last you have seen of them. For that very reason, it makes sense to let the animals learn that you are part of the landscape and not a threat to them. This takes patience and time.

Erin spent this summer retracing her family history and revisiting some of the sites relevant to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II --> Words from Erin \"My grandmother, Misa Hatakeyama, was 20 years old when she was sent to the prison camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming. I have so many memories of Gra, as we called her, from growing up - sitting next to her on our couch while she knit a sweater for me or for one of my siblings, trying desperately to master using chopsticks while she patiently demonstrated, or running to her terrified after accidentally catching an eel while fishing in the pond by our house. But Gra never talked about her time at Heart Mountain. So what I know about that period of her life is what I\u2019ve been able to glean from government records or the interpretive center that sits at the site of the former concentration camp, doing the work of memorializing the lives lived there during the just over three years that the camp was open. According to WRA records, Gra had completed nearly two years of college when the evacuation order went into effect. And from the registry at the Heart Mountain Wyoming Interpretive Center, I know that 20-year-old\n Misa volunteered to take the very first train out to Heart Mountain from the Pomona Assembly Center on August 12, 1942. She went by herself, without her older brother or her parents, to help finish setting up the mess hall or maybe the hospital. And she left Heart Mountain, with her parents, on June 9, 1943. I spent over a month this summer working at the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, to learn about who comes to visit and why and also to share my family's connection to the site. I found that my being there, representing an embodiment of the camp's legacy, sometimes helped to make the stories and the history more real for many visitors.

We have a big Sri Lankan community there so most of them are Buddhist. Very basically, Buddhism, if I explain it, is not to do evil. Do good, purify your mind. Not to do anything wrong, which is hard. So you need a definition for that. Whatever\u2019s harmful to you and to the other person is not good. Whatever is beneficial to you and to the other person is good. Either good or bad go into the category of Karma. So you stay on the good side, the positive side. How do you do that? \nBy practicing meditation, refining your mind. You know, our minds, we have so much luggage in there. Be aware of it. 'I can show you the path but you have to walk the path', that\u2019s what the Buddha said. When you practice meditation, you can see yourself.\n\nGreed, hatred and ignorance are the three root causes of all these crazy things that we do. Free yourself, find your own peace. That\u2019s the central message that Buddha gave. There are a lot of things that we are doing habitually and so what he was encouraging is don\u2019t live habitually, live mindfully. When you are mindfully living, you are concentrated about other people. Life is like a bubble of water\u2026like a dew drop which is hanging on the tip of a leaf. Any time it\u2019s fragile, any time it can drop off. So therefore, uncertainty is always there so don\u2019t leave any room for regret, do nice things. Do things that you can be happy [about] so that you are always prepared. What Buddha said was \u2018may all beings be well and happy.\u2019 That\u2019s all. You can practice it.

An attempt to reunite the babies with their mother failed, so they were rescued by Nebraska Wildlife Rehab.  When they first came into care, their eyes were closed, they weighed just a few ounces, and had very little hair.  They had to be fed a specialized formula every two hours until they were stable, and then six times a day until they were weaned onto solid food. They are mischievous animals, which makes them a unique challenge to rehabilitate.  They are fast and love to climb and swim and require extremely specialized housing with a variety of habitats that includes pools and dens. They also must eat on a very regular schedule -- minks, like all weasels, have a high metabolism and aren't able to skip meals like other mammals.  At Nebraska Wildlife Rehab this species makes up a small part of the over 6,000 animals they care for each year, but their unique and challenging personalities always make them a staff and volunteer favorite!

What we do or fail to do with the ocean in the next ten years will determine our fate in the next one hundred years. #FollowMe on @CristinaMittermeier for more dialogue on ocean conservation. #sustainable #nature #ocean #conservation", "314k", "612"], "2051": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f8b19da3f54d9fca1cc5e8cdcdd2b0a0/5C795E14/t51.2885-15/e15/c179.0.721.721/s640x640/39114675_553776335040348_8353829781493514240_n.jpg", "Photo by @Joelsartore\n\nThis is a critically endangered helmeted hornbill, found only in Sumatra and Borneo, with rare residence in the Malayan peninsula and southern Thailand.

The hornbill\u2019s casque, or \u201chelmet\u201d, allows them to pick up and manage food, helps to resonate sound when calling, and it has been suggested that the hornbill can also use the casque like a hammer.  Another threat to this species are native peoples in the Malaysian Peninsula, who hunt them due to the belief that their casques can protect them from evil spirits. The Penang Bird Park in Malaysia where this bird was photographed works to conserve this species and breed them in captivity. This bird is one of two helmeted hornbills at the park that were saved and donated by a local lumberjack who found the female and a her baby in the tree while he was working.  Knowing how rare this species was, he made sure to deliver the hornbills to Penang, where they have been carefully taken care of and kept healthy since their arrival. #Photoark #helmetedhornbill Follow @joelsartore to see a video of this hornbill!", "390k", "1,925"], "2052": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5f4019dc3a65e9dc7156fc484b159ccc/5C856307/t51.2885-15/e15/c180.0.720.720/s640x640/38721605_1203094176505818_8539554522538704896_n.jpg", "Photo  by  @pedromcbride // Walking  through  the  hidden  slot  canyons  of  the  Grand  Canyon  is  a  window  through  rock  and  time.

Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods.\n\nWhat is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory \u2013 and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

Lions are iconic - strong and proud and symbols of power throughout the world. But there are now more statues of lions in the world than there are real lions. Only around 20 000 remain, scattered in ever-smaller patches of wilderness. It's worth noting this decline this #WorldLionDay but also noting that we have the ability to halt and reverse it when we put our minds to it. Nine years ago, together with @dereckjoubert, and National Geographic, we set up the Big Cats Initiative as a long-term effort to halt the declineof big cats in the wild. The initiative supports efforts to save big cats through assessment, on-the-ground conservation, education, and global public-awareness campaigns. To date, this has supported more than 110 innovative projects in 28 countries that are helping big cats and communities thrive - all working to keep these wild eyes alight across Africa, ready to pierce our souls with the truth about who we really are.

In 2010 in partnership with the Chadian Government, conservation organization African Parks @africanparksnetwork assumed management of the park  and overhauled law enforcement. It wasn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Just a year after cracking down on poaching, six rangers will killed by poachers during their morning prayers before going out on patrol.

Employment is on the rise, thousands of children are going to schools built by the park, and tourism is booming.\nRhinos were even reintroduced after a 50-year absence just in May, and elephants are on the rise for the first time in a decade.

She sets up her open-air theater on the roof: a few chairs, wicker loveseats, a couple of hammocks and a white sheet to serve as the projection screen.\ufffdThis anecdote may be all that's needed to convey her desire to create a real rapport with this place and its people. Sabali is Italian, born in Livorno, Tuscany to an Italian mother and a Beninese father. \"In Italy, I was always the black girl. In Africa, I was white. Here in Haiti, I'm just a 'sister',\" she told me. It was work that brought her here. She's an agronomist, specialized in tropical crops, and is heading up a program to relaunch Haiti's coffee industry. The country used to be famous the world over for growing and selling coffee, but production has fallen off in the last thirty years. She took me to see where she spends her days, amidst the groves of coffee trees clinging to the mountain slopes, a crop to which she devotes endless time and patience. She and her partner have explored the most remote corners of Haiti together. They took me on long motorcycle rides through wild landscapes and along muddy, broken roads. More than once I closed my eyes, fervently hoping nothing would happen to us along the way. They enjoy cooking and usually have guests at home, like me. When Sabali rented the house, it was explained to her that there were also guards who would ensure her home was secure day and night. It seems that, in Haiti, this is more of a necessity than a nicety. It was news to me and I found it a little shocking. My hosts explained that, in order to adapt to a local culture, foreigners sometimes have to behave how the locals expect them to, and that includes having guards. Later, however, I noticed that their guards were unarmed and that their biggest task, it seemed, was to maintain backyard security, watching over chickens, goats, sheep, a horse and a cow.

Here in Zakouma National Park in Chad, after a devastating eight years where poaching reduced the elephant population from 4,000 to 400, the rangers are doing more than just holding the line. In 2010 in partnership with the Chadian Government, conservation organization African Parks @africanparksnetwork assumed management of the park  and overhauled law enforcement. It wasn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Just a year after cracking down on poaching, six rangers will killed by poachers during their morning prayers before going out on patrol. But the rangers persevered and continued in their fight to protect the Park, its wildlife, and the surrounding communities. Eight years later, poaching has essentially become non-existent. Employment is on the rise, thousands of children are going to schools built by the park, and tourism is booming.\nRhinos were even reintroduced after a 50-year absence just in May, and elephants are on the rise for the first time in a decade. A record number of elephant calves were recently counted - showing new life and hope has been restored to Zakouma, thanks to the rangers.

The golden eagle is the top predator in the Scottish countryside; it is a massive bird of prey that mainly hunts rabbits and mountain hares but will also catches foxes, young deer and large birds like grouse. It can be seen soaring high in the sky in upland areas and remote glens in the north and west of Scotland. Golden eagles have large home territories, nesting on rocky cliff faces and in trees where it builds a giant nest or \u2018eyrie\u2019. These nests are often used by successive generations to rear their own young. Golden eagles pair for life. It's the national bird of Germany, Austria, Mexico and Kazakhstan, and many here in Scotland consider it to be their national bird too. It is revered by many, forming the basis of everything from coats of arms to spiritual customs, and is used to hunt and kill wolves in some countries. Golden Eagles are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981, and classified in the UK as an Amber List species under the Birds of Conservation Concern review.

The Makgadikgadi salt pans in Botswana form a harsh, blindingly white and inhospitable environment where the sun beats down onto salt-encrusted earth. Only the toughest animal species pass through here in the dry summer months. But when the rains come, the dust is settled, the sky is mirrored in the shallow pans, nutrient-rich grass grows around the edges and zebras appear in vast numbers. This is an ancient migration from the Okavango and one that was thought to be lost following the erection of wildlife fences in the 1960s to keep wildlife and livestock separate. In 2006 the Nxai Pan fence was removed. It had previously completely blocked access to the pans along these migratory routes and zebras and wildebeest hadn't been able to follow the rains to renewed grazing grounds. Remarkably, despite numerous generations unable to migrate, the removal of the fence immediately resulted in the zebra descendants following those same paths once again. As human activity has interrupted numerous migrations across the world, it is important to know that if we remove barriers, it is possible that these ancient routes will revive and animals will connect important ecosystems seasonally once again. #botswanamigration #zebramigration #makgadikgadi #ancientpaths #aerial #migration", "286k", "603"], "2253": ["https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/73e07d7d379c6fb483246ad379d46b0f/5C6F6C6F/t51.2885-15/e15/c108.0.864.864a/s640x640/37667628_1679894215392761_4864318777916915712_n.jpg", "Photo by @adamfergusonphoto | Children play on Beniamina Island in Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, June, 2018.

For me, living in working in Florida, the first place in America to receive cattle from Spain in 1521, cattlemen and cattlewomen are heroes and keepers of the last frontier for large landscape conservation in the east. Millions of acres of rangelands, particularly in south-central Florida, make up nearly half of the Florida Wildlife Corridor which keeps the vast public lands of the southern Everglades connected to the rest of the state and country. Suburban sprawl in Florida is consuming ranches and farms at a rate of 100,000 acres per year to accommodate 1,000 new residents who move here every day. Ranchers committed to their land and heritage are our best defense against development, and investing in conservation easements is the best thing we can do to protect ranches, sustain the Everglades headwaters and save the Florida Wildlife Corridor. Bears and panthers need these ranches for their survival and so do people. And cattlemen and cattlewomen here are the reason we still have a chance.

Growing up in Virginia I vividly remember neighbors cutting the heads off every snake they saw. Much of the time the person thought it was funny and somehow manly that they killed a creature 1000 Times smaller than them, which is puzzling to me. In almost every case the person thought the snake was venomous (not that a venomous snake deserves that fate either) but usually it was a black rat snake or rough brown water snake, which are completely harmless and important to controlling rodent populations which are far more dangerous to human health. This culture of killing snakes doesn\u2019t just exist in the United States, believe me, it is healthy and alive almost everywhere I\u2019ve been, including Peru, where people typically kill any snake they see. In some cases, with anacondas anyways, they keep the dried heads in their homes as good luck charms. The dried head you see in the hands of @paulrosolie is one such head, taken from a 15 foot female anaconda with the belief it would bring good luck. As far as I could tell the man who killed this snake and took the head has had no change in luck. This is the mission @paulrosolie and I are on: to deconstruct the myth snakes are evil and one by one convince people snakes are better off alive, for all involved. Moving forward , Paul and I are working to set up a non profit fund to reimburse people in Puerto Maldonado, Peru who lose a chicken or goat or whatever to anaconda. This is an experiment we hope makes some difference. But we need your help .

Chop a piece of ginger and put it inside and outside the fish. Heat two spoons of oil in a pan and fry the fish for 10 minutes on each side. Drain it from the oil. If you have the rice cooking machine, you can use it, otherwise boil the rice in some water. Wash two bunches of spinach and cut them in stripes. Boil everything in some water for ten minutes and drain. Wash the tomatoes, aubergines and green mangoes and dice them. Heat two spoons of oil in a pan and when it is hot enough add, first, the tomatoes and, 5 minutes later, the aubergines. At this point, add a teaspoon of curry, one of masala and two pinches of salt. Let it cook for 5 more minutes and then add the mangoes. Wait for 5 more minutes and add the boiled spinach. Stir the mixture and pour a glass of water.
